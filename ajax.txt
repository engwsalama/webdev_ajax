Section1: Introduction ==========

Synchronous Code
=================
posts =loadPostsSync();
// ... Wait til posts are fetched
// ... do something with posts

doTheNextThing(); // Has to wait until posts load
there are many factors to be considered such as band-width , network speed , etc.

In this way of writing this code we're going to have to wait until the posts are fetched and then do something with the post and then only after that's done can we nove on to the doNextThing() function
so this is what's called a blocking code.
It's going to block until the posts are fetched and loaded wchich obviously slows things down


Asynchronous Code
=================
loadPostsAsync(function(){
	// ... Wait til posts are fetched
	// ... do something with posts

});

doTheNextThing(); // Doesn't has to wait until posts load

- In this cas instead of just pulling th post out of a sync fucntion we are passing in a callback function which is just one method for handling a sync code.
- this call back will run and fetch the posts and allow us to do something with the post
- but the doTheNextThing() does not have to wait until the posts are fetched and loaded

- so , the program is not blocked and it will simply jsut keep going even if it takes a while for the posts to be fetched

- It is not going to stop the doTheNextThing() function from running.

- In turn this is much faster and that's the beauty of async javascript and async programing (AJAX)

================ Section 2: Browser/Server APIs ====
Most Async code you work with will be part of an API or Library, such as 
 - Ajax and XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object

There is a few ways to handle Async code such as :
- Callbacks
- promises







What is Ajax
Asyncronous JavScript And XML
Ajax is Not programming language its Technique coantain many technologies
DOM => Interacting with Data and Display it
XML/JSON => Get & Send Data to the Server
XMLHttpRequest => Making the communication with the server
Javascript => Connect all Technologies together

How it works
you open the webpage
choose option from selectbox
a request will send to the server
a response will get data back
part of the page is updated with the data comes from the the server withouth refresh the page

What can we do with Ajax
Allows Content on Webpages to updae immediately when a user performs an action
you can send and receive information in various formats such as JSON,XML,HTML,and TextFiles
You don't need to reload the page to show data
you can contiue to use the application while the application requests information from the server in the background

Examples
Google Search
uploding youtube videos
writing post in facebook
attaching email in gmail

Deal with Network Requesta and Status Codes
- open Netowrk tab
- 404 / 500/ 429
